# installation notes

## install on mac
update rstudio & r to latest version (Pile of Leaves)
following: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html

unpack,
install bookdown
install tinytex
get to build all and get TinyTex error
xelatex
mac installation on https://yihui.org/tinytex/ seems to fix it

now have downlit & xml2 package errors
install downlit & xml2

renders under Build

## Locally update immediately w/o needing to rerender

install.packages("servr")

bookdown::serve_book(dir = ".", output_dir = "_book", preview = TRUE,
           in_session = TRUE, quiet = FALSE)

## publishing book
while the serve_book will allow local update, it doesn't update the files in docs. to do that, use "install package" or "Build All" under "Build" in the menu
