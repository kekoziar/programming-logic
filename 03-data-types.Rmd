# Data types

## Variables

Now that we understand the structure and logic of algorithms, we can start on how the natural language of algorithms is translated into programming scripts. In order to do this, we need to introduce closely related concepts of variables, data types, and data structures (data structures might be too early, but maybe not.)

A word that people use a lot when referring to computer code is _variable_, but what is a variable?  A variable is a placeholder for some type of data that will be used in computer code.  

`ingredients <- cheddar cheese, potatoes, milk, salt, butter`

We use variables to represent the data that are being used to because it's easy to change it, 

`ingredients <- smoked gouda cheese, potatoes, milk, salt, butter`

and also easy to build a mental model of how the different variables interrelate.  

```
ingredients <- smoked gouda cheese, potatoes, milk, salt, butter
ingredient_quantities <- all, 3 lb, 0.5 c, to taste, 8 tbsp
```
### Pro-tip

A common rule for what name to use for a variable is the name should describe what the data represent.  If we used the term `x` - which is commonly used as a variable in math equations - we wouldn't know what it represents.  Using the word `ingredients` is descriptive, so you have an idea what the data are in the variable, and what it represents.

Something I'd commonly do when helping researchers with their code, especially when I'd see variable names which are abbreviations, is I'd ask them if the abbreviation is something which is commonly used in their field.  My questions would usually go something like this:

- So you know, I'm not an expert in your field.  You're the expert.  Can you help me understand a little more about what you're trying to do in the code?
- What does `w_f` represent?
- Is that something someone who is knowledgeable in your field would recognize?
- It's good practice to use self-describing variables which someone in the field would recognize.  It's also a good idea to keep track of information about your data and related variables in a README or data dictionary.  Honestly, I've heard a lot of different terms to describe them, but it's basically a file that describes your data.  I can give you an example if you want.
