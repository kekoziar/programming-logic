## Variables

Now that we understand the structure and logic of algorithms, we can start on how the natural language of algorithms is translated into programming scripts. In order to do this, we need to introduce closely related concepts of variables, data types, and data structures (data structures might be too early, but maybe not.)

A word that people use a lot when referring to computer code is _variables_, but what is a variable?  A variable is a placeholder for some type of data that will be used in computer code.  

`ingredients <- cheddar cheese, potatoes, milk, salt, butter`

We use variables to represent the data that are being used to because it's easy to change it, 

`ingredients <- smoked gouda cheese, potatoes, milk, salt, butter`

and also easy to build a mental model of how the different variables interrelate.  

```
ingredients <- smoked gouda cheese, potatoes, milk, salt, butter
ingredient_quantities <- all, 3 lb, 0.5 c, to taste, 8 tbsp
```
### Pro-tip

A common rule for naming variables is they should describe they data they represent.  If we used the term `x` - which is commonly used as a variable in math equations - we wouldn't know what it represents.  Using the word `ingredients` is descriptive, so you know at a glance what it represents.
