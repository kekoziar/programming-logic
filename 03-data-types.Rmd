# Data types

A word that people use a lot when referring to computer code is _variables_, but what is a variable?  A variable is a placeholder for some type of data that will be used in computer code.  

`ingredients <- cheddar cheese, potatoes, milk, salt, butter`

We use variables to represent the data that are being used to because it's easy to change it, 

`ingredients <- smoked gouda cheese, potatoes, milk, salt, butter`

and also easy to build a mental model of how the different variables interrelate.  



A most simple example of this is to use variables to describe an equation.  A common rule for naming variables is they should represent what the data are.
