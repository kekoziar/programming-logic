It’s not because they know all programming languages, but because most programming languages use the same concepts and logic. STRUCTURE(workshop) In this interactive workshop, attendees will gain hands-on experience to understand and interpret programming logic. We will cover fundamental topics in programming including: conditional statements, loops, order of operations and logical flow, functions and arguments, and data types. Attendees will practice formulating programming arguments to accomplish common tasks, such as subsetting data based on a set of conditions. WHERE prior_experience == FALSE No coding experience required! Programming logic is transferable across specific languages, so learners will focus on concepts, rather than specific syntax from a specific language. Attendees will learn to interpret programming logic and build confidence to apply their understanding to various programming languages they may encounter. FOR (x in example1:example5) {annotate(x)} To provide real world examples of programming logic in practice, the workshop will integrate hands-on work time with examples of sample code written in R, Python, SQL, Stata, and other languages. Attendees will practice annotating code in human understandable language and discuss the process, and any pitfalls, with their peers and the instructors.
