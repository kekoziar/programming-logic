Attendees practice formulating programming arguments accomplish common tasks, subsetting data based set conditions.prior_experience == FALSENo coding experience required! Programming logic transferable across specific languages, learners focus concepts, rather specific syntax specific language. Attendees learn interpret programming logic build confidence apply understanding various programming languages may encounter.(x example1:example5) {annotate(x)}provide real world examples programming logic practice, workshop integrate hands-work time examples sample code written R, Python, SQL, Stata, languages.
