# Common Issues

Some common issues

## Difference between `=` and `==`

The former, `=` is used to set something as equal as in `x = 5` where
the variable `x` is equal to, or has a value of, `5`. Conversely, the
double equal `==` is used to test for equality. For instance, if we set
a variable x to equal the value 5, the code `x == 5` would return `True`
and the code `x == 6` would return `False`.\

## Spelling and capitalization matter

The variable `x` is different from the variable `X`. Likewise, a
function `mean()` and a function `Mean()` would be separate functions.

## Special characters and words

Many programming languages reserve specific words for specific tasks.
For example, a function called `sum()` is fairly common across
languages. While you *could* make your own alternate function called
`sum()`, this may lead to unexpected results when using the `sum()`
function\

Similarly, it is best practice to avoid naming variables or objects the
same as common function names. Again, while you *could* write code like
`sum = sum()`, this will get confusing for you, and may lead to
unexpected results and code behavior downstream.

The same is true for certain characters. Many programming languages
treat `NA` as a special class of missing value. This is *not* the same
as `"NA"`, which would instead be a character string containing the
letters NA.

## Ending a code chunk

Ending a statement (needing ; or other conclusion)

## Order of operations

overwriting/ variable will be whatever most recently set as

## Others [work in progress]

Closing quotes and parenthese\
Direct comparison of multiple syntax, so like the same task in R,
Python, C, SQL, Stata, Java  You don’t need to memorize specifics!
Reading and writing data / files\
Syntax is going to be specific to a language, or package within a
language\
Show some examples of reading/writing data in R, Python, Stata, SQL
