# Common Issues

Here are some common issues that we've seen during consultations.  While we've covered some of these in prior chapters, it's worth having a list to review. 

## Difference between `=` and `==`

The former, `=` is used to set something as equal as in `x = 5` where
the variable `x` is equal to, or has a value of, `5`. Conversely, the
double equal `==` is used to test for equality. For instance, if we set
a variable x to equal the value 5, the code `x == 5` would return `True`
and the code `x == 6` would return `False`.\

## Spelling and capitalization matter

The variable `x` is different from the variable `X`. Likewise, a
function `mean()` and a function `Mean()` would be separate functions.

## Special characters and words

Many programming languages reserve specific words for specific tasks.
For example, a function called `sum()` is fairly common across
languages. While you *could* make your own alternate function called
`sum()`, this may lead to unexpected results when using the `sum()`
function\

Similarly, it is best practice to avoid naming variables or objects the
same as common function names. Again, while you *could* write code like
`sum = sum()`, this will get confusing for you, and may lead to
unexpected results and code behavior downstream.

The same is true for certain characters. Many programming languages
treat `NA` as a special class of missing value. This is *not* the same
as `"NA"`, which would instead be a character string containing the
letters NA.

## Ending a code chunk

Certain programming languages require a character at the end of a line or statement.  

**C/C++, Java, and PHP** all require a semi-colon `;` at the end of lines or statements.

Why do we say _statement_?  Because technically you could write your code 

```
if(x == y){cout << "values are equal";x++;cout<<"x was increased & is now 
equal to "<<fixed<<setprecision(1)<<x<<endl;}else if(x > y){cout << "x greater 
than y";x--cout<<"x was reduced & is now equal to "<< fixed <<setprecision(1)
<<x<<endl;} else {cout << "x must be less than y";x++;cout<<"x was increased 
& is now equal to "<<fixed<<setprecision(1)<<x<<endl;}
```
But, there's an error in that code. A semi-colon is required but missing. 
Can you find it?  

Having each statement on its own line is easier to read.  
```
if (x == y) {
  cout << "values are equal";
  x++;
  cout << "x was increased & is now equal to " << fixed << setprecision(1) << x << endl;
} else if (x > y) {
  cout << "x greater than y";
  x--
  cout << "x was reduced & is now equal to " << fixed << setprecision(1) << x << endl;
} else {
  cout << "x must be less than y";
  x++;
  cout << "x was increased & is now equal to " << fixed << setprecision(1) << x << endl;
}
```
