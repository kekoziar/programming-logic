# Functions

## What is a function?

A "function" in programming is a piece of code that does a specific task with a single line of code.  We've already been using examples of informal functions - such as when we would include the `write` statement - and formal functions, such as `print`, `cout`, or `echo` statements we just saw in the conditional examples at the end of the previous chapter.  

The `print` function does something very simple, which is provide output, either on the R or Python console or interface, that people can read.  It's quite simple to use, but internal code that creates the print function is a little more complex (to say the least).  But, communicating output is ubiquitous in all computer languages, so each language has some sort of print function as a built in function.

Really, functions are created when you know you're going to do the same task over and over again.  

Functions can do something very simple or very complex.  Take our cheesy mashed potatoes example, a simple function might be something like `peel_potatoes()`, while a complex function would be `make_cheesy_mashed_potatoes()`, which is the equivalent to having an in-home chef who can make you cheesy mashed potatoes on demand, as long as you provide the raw ingredients. 

```
make_cheesy_mashed_potatoes(cheese, potatoes, milk, salt, butter)
```
In programming parlance, these ingredients listed `(cheese, potatoes, milk, salt, butter)` would be the "arguments".
 
## Arguments

Functions will have inputs _(usually)_ and outputs. The function inputs are formally called "arguments," and are specified by the programmer, entered within the parentheses as part of the function call. For cheesy mashed potatoes, this could be specifying what kind of cheese to use, or the quantity of each ingredient. 

While our example is in pseudocode, luckily function calls look the same across most languages.  

```
# these variables have quantities in oz
cheese <- 16
potatoes <- 32
milk <- 8
salt <- 0.125
butter <- 4

make_cheesy_mashed_potatoes(cheese, potatoes, milk, salt, butter)

paste("this function uses", cheese, "oz of cheese")

```

For our `mean()` function example, the primary argument would be what kind of input to put in: `mean(x)` where `x` is a list or vector of values. Another argument might be an option for how to handle missing or `NA` values: `mean(x, na.rm = FALSE)` where the default value of `na.rm` is `FALSE`, indicating that `NA` values will _not_ be removed from the calculation. 

Optional arguments like this may come with a pre-supplied default, in this case that `na.rm = FALSE` and any `NA`values will be retained, unless this argument is manually changed to `TRUE`.\

It is important to understand (a) what arguments are in a function and (b) what arguments are optional and what the defaults are. A function will run as long as the non-optional arguments are completed (that is, input is specified), but the resulting output may not match expectations unless you understand what other optional arguments were included, and what the default values were.\

Putting this into practice, let's return to the `mean()` function where our arguments are input (mandatory) and handling of `NA` values (optional).

If we only input the mandatory argument of specifying input:
```
values <- c(2, 4, 7, 5, 9, NA)
mean(values)

```
The output of this function would be `NA`, because if we retain the `NA` values - which we do by default in the `mean()` function, then the mean will necessary be `NA`. For a computer, the sum of a set of values plus `NA` will always be `NA`, and taking the mean of `NA` will also return `NA`.

Conversely, if we specify that we want to remove `NA` values from our mean calculation:

```
values <- c(2, 4, 7, 5, 9, NA)
mean(values, na.rm = TRUE)

```
Now our output is `5.4` which is the mean of `values` excluding `NA`.

## Libraries

Programming languages will have a variety of functions for common tasks ready to use without any additional work. These are called "built in" functions and are available to use right away.\

However, built in functions are often limited to basic tasks and do not include more complex or custom functions that you may with to use. Now, you can code more complex functions yourself, building off of the built in functions, but this would take a lot of time and require more in-depth programming knowledge.

The good news is that most programming languages will have optional "libraries" (or packages, or modules, depending on what term your programming language of choice uses) that include additional functions, beyond the built in function. So before creating a new function from scratch, it is worthwhile to check whether a library exists that includes a function that does what you want to do.\

_It gets a bit tricky to extend our cheesy mashed potatoes example to more complex topics like this, but libraries are kind of like this: You want to make cheesy mashed potatoes from scratch, but don't have the time to do so. Luckily someone else has created instant mashed potatoes, so all you have to do is add boiling water and stir. You can add your own flair to the resulting potatoes if you want, but the important part is that someone else has done a lot of the work and you can build off it, rather than doing it all yourself._

You can also think of programming libraries as serving a role similar to actual libraries. For instance, you don't need to memorize every historical event, or write your favorite novel from scratch - you can check out a book from a library to read and learn more!\

In the same way, your computer and your programming language of choice doesn't need to always have every single function on hand, which would take up a lot of space. Instead, it can "check out" (load) a "book" (collection of functions) created by another person. You can then use those additional functions the same way you would any function.\

This set up saves computer disk space, ensures you don't have to recreate the wheel and make every function from scratch, and provides a level of standardization (e.g., everyone uses the same reference "book" so output should be the same for the same input, across users).\

A good rule of thumb is if it _seems_ like the function you want is broadly useful, then someone has likely created a library containing it. This is also true for niche or domain-specific functions: if the task is one that comes up a lot in analysis, there is likely a library that has functions for those analysis tasks.\

Finding the 'right' library for the function you need can be overwhelming, but a good starting point is the official library collection for a programming language, such as [CRAN for R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) or [PyPI for Python](https://pypi.org/).

## Accessing functions in libraries

The syntax for accessing functions in libraries varies by programming language but follows the general process of:

1. Install the library from the source. You only need to do this once. 
2. Load or import the library. You will need to do this every time you want to access a function in a library. By convention, libraries are loaded at the top of a script, so you, and other people, can see at a glance what libraries are needed to run the script.
3. Use the functions as normal.

### Caveats

### Function names

There are only so many function names that make sense in the English language, so there may be functions from _different libraries_ that have the same name. How does the programming language know which function you are trying to access? By default, the language will use the function of the more recently loaded or imported package.

Let's say we have two `mean()` functions, one from library `A` and one from library `B`. They differ in their default settings: 

- library `A` defauls to `na.rm = TRUE`
- library `B` defaults to `na.rm = FALSE`

If we load libraries in order `A` then `B` and then use `mean()` as a function, we will be using the `mean()` function from library `B`.

```
load(A)
load(B)

values <- c(2, 4, 7, 5, 9, NA)
mean(values)

```
Our result will be `NA`.

Conversely, if we load library `B` then library `A`, we will use the `mean()` function from library `A`.

```
load(B)
load(A)

values <- c(2, 4, 7, 5, 9, NA)
mean(values)

```

Our value will be `5.4`.

The tricky part is that all this happens invisibly. There may or may not - depending on your programming language - be a warning that two libraries contain functions of the same name. So, keeping track of your order of loading is important. If you get any unexpected results, you can double check which library the function you are using is from.\

An alternative method is to be explicit about which function you are calling. Most programming languages will allow a syntax along the lines of `library:function()` to specify use of a function from a stated library.\

```
load(B)
load(A)

values <- c(2, 4, 7, 5, 9, NA)
B:mean(values)

#result will be `NA`

```
### Aliases

You may encounter the concept of an "alias" for a library. This is common in Python, where users can set an alias for a library name, and use that going forward rather than writing out the full library name. This will mostly come up if you are looking for help online, or wondering why you are seeing abbreviations.

For example, Python uses the `import` term to load a library (or "package" as Python calls them) and allows setting an alias using `import package as alias` syntax. By convention, many Python users will use standard aliases for common packages, such as:

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

Functions can then be called using the explicit `package:function` syntax, such as `pd.DataFrame` to designate a `pandas` `DataFrame` object.


## Activity reprise for functions

Let's return to the section 2 activity where your group created an algorithm to make popcorn. 

- How would you adapt your step by step narrative algorithm to be a function called `make_popcorn()`? 
- What arguments would be included, and would you have any default values set?
- Does your function look different than others in your group? How would you tell the computer which function you wanted to use?


<details>
<summary>Example functions</summary>

```
# specify which library we want to get a function from, in this case instructor Steph

from Steph import make_popcorn()

# set arguments and defaults

make_popcorn(type = microwave, time = 2 minutes, flavor = movie_theater_flavor, seasoning = TRUE)

# example in use
# keeping all defaults, but changing time because this microwave 
# is known to burn popcorn at recommended time

make_popcorn(time = 1.5 minutes)
```
