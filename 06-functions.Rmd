# Functions

## What is a function?

A "function" in programming is a piece of code that does a specific task with a single line of code.  We've already been using examples of informal functions - such as when we would include the `write` statement - and formal functions, such as `print`, `cout`, or `echo` statements we just saw in the conditional examples at the end of the previous chapter.  

The `print` function does something very simple, which is provide output, either on the R or Python console or interface, that people can read.  It's quite simple to use, but internal code that creates the print function is a little more complex (to say the least).  But, communicating output is ubiquitous in all computer languages, so each language has some sort of print function as a built in function.

Really, functions are created when you know you're going to do the same task over and over again.  

Functions can do something very simple or very complex.  Take our cheesy mashed potatoes example, a simple function might be something like `peel_potatoes()`, while a complex function would be `make_cheesy_mashed_potatoes()`, which is the equivalent to having an in-home chef who can make you cheesy mashed potatoes on demand, as long as you provide the raw ingredients. 

```
make_cheesy_mashed_potatoes(cheese, potatoes, milk, salt, butter)
```
In programming parlance, these ingredients listed `(cheese, potatoes, milk, salt, butter)` would be the "arguments".
 
## Arguments

Functions will have inputs _(usually)_ and outputs. The function inputs are formally called "arguments," and are specified by the programmer, entered within the parentheses as part of the function call. For cheesy mashed potatoes, this could be specifying what kind of cheese to use, or the quantity of each ingredient. 

While our example is in pseudocode, luckily function calls look the same across most languages.  

```
# these variables have quantities in oz
cheese <- 16
potatoes <- 32
milk <- 8
salt <- 0.125
butter <- 4

make_cheesy_mashed_potatoes(cheese, potatoes, milk, salt, butter)

paste("this function uses", cheese, "oz of cheese")

```

We already mentioned that `print` is a common built-in function.  Most languages a number of built-in functions which are commonly used, such as the `paste` function in R, represented above.  Let's look at another built in function that is common to both R and Python:  `round()`

Built-in functions have help pages which will allow you to see the syntax and arguments.  The help files will include definitions of the arguments, if they're required or have a default, and examples for use.  

The syntax for Python is `round(number, ndigits=None)`

The syntax for R is `round(x, digits = 0, ...)`, where `x` is a numeric vector.

https://search.r-project.org/R/refmans/base/html/Round.html
https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round

The second argument for both languages indicates the number of digits along with the default value.  Since there's a default value, you don't necessarily need to include the argument in the function call. 

An example in R is
``` {r function-round}
round(c(1.4, 2.5, 3.5))
```

Another argument common in many functions which deal with statistics is how to handle missing or `NA` values, for example, the function `mean()`: `mean(x, na.rm = FALSE)` where the default value of `na.rm` is `FALSE`, indicating that `NA` values will _not_ be removed from the calculation. 

Optional arguments like this may come with a pre-supplied default, in this case that `na.rm = FALSE` and any `NA`values will be retained, unless this argument is manually changed to `TRUE`.\

When working with functions, which is the vast majority of programming, it is important to keep in mind a two things

1. The arguments in a function 
2. Which arguments are optional, and what are their defaults

A function will run as long as the required arguments are provided, but the resulting output may not match expectations unless you recognize which optional arguments were included with default values.

## Libraries

We've already discussed built-in functions.  Built in functions are often limited to basic tasks and do not include more complex or custom functions that you may with to use. Now, you can code more complex functions yourself, building off of the built in functions, but this would take a lot of time and require more in-depth programming knowledge.

The good news is that most programming languages will have optional "libraries" (or packages, or modules, depending on what term your programming language of choice uses) that include additional functions, beyond the built in function. So before creating a new function from scratch, it is worthwhile to check whether a library exists that includes a function that does what you want to do.\

_Using our cheesy mashed potatoes example you might use a programming library to find a recipe that uses different ingredients. You want to make cheesy mashed potatoes from scratch, but don't have the time to do so. Luckily someone else has created function that uses instant mashed potatoes instead of raw potatoes._

You can also think of programming libraries as serving a role similar to actual libraries. For instance, you don't need to memorize every historical event, or write your favorite novel from scratch - you can check out a book from a library to read and learn more!\

In the same way, your computer and your programming language of choice doesn't need to always have every single function on hand, which would take up a lot of space. Instead, it can "check out" (load) a "book" (collection of functions) created by another person. You can then use those additional functions the same way you would any function.\

This set up saves computer disk space, ensures you don't have to recreate the wheel and make every function from scratch, and provides a level of standardization (e.g., everyone uses the same reference "book" so output should be the same for the same input, across users).\

A good rule of thumb is if it _seems_ like the function you want is broadly useful, then someone has likely created a library containing it. This is also true for niche or domain-specific functions: if the task is one that comes up a lot in analysis, there is likely a library that has functions for those analysis tasks.\

Finding the 'right' library for the function you need can be overwhelming, but a good starting point is the official library collection for a programming language, such as [CRAN for R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) or [PyPI for Python](https://pypi.org/).

## Accessing functions in libraries

The syntax for accessing functions in libraries varies by programming language but follows the general process of:

1. Install the library from the source. You only need to do this once. 
2. Load or import the library. You will need to do this every time you want to access a function in a library. By convention, libraries are loaded at the top of a script, so you, and other people, can see at a glance what libraries are needed to run the script.
3. Use the functions as normal.

### Caveats

### Function names

There are only so many function names that make sense in the English language, so there may be functions from _different libraries_ that have the same name. How does the programming language know which function you are trying to access? By default, the language will use the function of the more recently loaded or imported package.

Let's say we have two `mean()` functions, one from `library_A` and one from `library_B`. They differ in their default settings: 

- `library_A` defauls to `na.rm = TRUE`
- `library_B` defaults to `na.rm = FALSE`

If we load libraries in order `library_A` then `library_B` and then use `mean()` as a function, we will be using the `mean()` function from `library_B`.

```
load(library_A)
load(library_B)

values <- c(2, 4, 7, 5, 9, NA)
mean(values)

```
Our result will be `NA`.

Conversely, if we load `library_B` then `library_A`, we will use the `mean()` function from `library_A`.

```
load(library_B)
load(library_A)

values <- c(2, 4, 7, 5, 9, NA)
mean(values)

```

Our value will be `5.4`.

The tricky part is that all this happens invisibly. There may or may not - depending on your programming language - be a warning that two libraries contain functions of the same name. So, keeping track of your order of loading is important. If you get any unexpected results, you can double check which library the function you are using is from.\

A better method is to be explicit about which function you are calling. Most programming languages will allow a syntax along the lines of `library:function()` to specify use of a function from a stated library.\

```
load(library_B)
load(library_A)

values <- c(2, 4, 7, 5, 9, NA)
library_B:mean(values)

#result will be `NA`

```
### Aliases

You may encounter the concept of an "alias" for a library. This is common in Python, where users can set an alias for a library name, and use that going forward rather than writing out the full library name. This will mostly come up if you are looking for help online, or wondering why you are seeing abbreviations.

For example, Python uses the `import` term to load a library (or "package" as Python calls them) and allows setting an alias using `import package as alias` syntax. By convention, many Python users will use standard aliases for common packages, such as:

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

Functions can then be called using the explicit `package:function` syntax, such as `pd.DataFrame` to designate a `pandas` `DataFrame` object.


## Activity reprise for functions

Let's return to the section 2 activity where your group created an algorithm to make popcorn. 

- How would you adapt your step by step narrative algorithm to be a function called `make_popcorn()`? 
- What arguments would be included, and would you have any default values set?
- Does your function look different than others in your group? How would you tell the computer which function you wanted to use?


<details>
<summary>Example functions</summary>

```
# specify which library we want to get a function from, in this case instructor Steph

from Steph import make_popcorn()

# set arguments and defaults

make_popcorn(type = microwave, time = 2 minutes, flavor = movie_theater_flavor, seasoning = TRUE)

# example in use
# keeping all defaults, but changing time because this microwave 
# is known to burn popcorn at recommended time

make_popcorn(time = 1.5 minutes)
```

```
# specify which library we want to get a function from, in this case instructor Kat

from Kat import make_popcorn()

# The arguments and defaults for this library is
# make_popcorn(quantity_popcorn, quantity_oil = 1, type = stovetop, butter = TRUE, salt = "light")
# where quantity is in tbsp

# example in use

make_popcorn(2)
