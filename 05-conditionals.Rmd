# Conditionals and Making Choices

Many times in programming, we want to take a certain action only if a certain condition is satisfied.\

To do this, we can use conditional statements. The most commonly used format of a conditional statement in programming is an `if` statement, which is often combined with an `else` statement.\

This structure tells the computer to check a condition and the next step depends on whether the condition is true or false. 

It takes the basic form of:

```
IF (condition A is TRUE)
  do something
  
```

In terms of our cheesy mashed potatoes algorithm, an `if` statement might look like this

```
ingredient <- cheddar cheese

IF (ingredient is (a type of hard cheese))
  grate(ingredient)
  
```

In that example, we've told the computer what to do _if_ the condition is true. We can also specify what to do if the condition is false. 

For our cheesy mashed potatoes algorithm, we may want to cut cheese into cubes if it is not a hard cheese:

```
ingredient <- cheddar cheese

IF (ingredient is (a type of hard cheese))
  grate(ingredient)
ELSE
  cube(ingredient)
  
```

In a generic programming format, a complete `if else` statement would look like: 

```
IF (condition A is TRUE)
  do something
ELSE 
  do something different
  
```

Here, `else` is used equivalent to "if not true", meaning `A == FALSE`.\

Furthermore, we are not limited to a single `TRUE`/`FALSE` check in an `if else` statement, where actions are limited to "do something if true, in all other scenarios do something different". The `else if` (written as `elif` in some programming languages) concept allows us to add another sequential check if the `if` statement is not true. 

An updated cheesy mashed potato narrative statement could be that if we have a hard cheese, we want to grate it, if we have a soft cheese we want to cube it, and if we have something that is neither hard nor soft cheese, we don't put it in the potatoes.

```
IF (ingredient is (a type of hard cheese))
  grate(ingredient)
ELSE IF (ingredient is (a type of soft cheese))
  cube(ingredient)
ELSE
  don't use
  
```

In generic programming format, this updated statement would look like: 

```
IF (condition A is TRUE)
  do something
ELSE IF (condition B is true)
  do something different
ELSE 
  do something even more different
  
```

__Exercise__: Let's try a similar example with the popcorn algorithm from section 2. 

Write out an `if else` statement specifying what appliance to use in the case of microwave vs stovetop popcorn.
Write out an `if, else if, else` statement that includes an air fry scenario.

<details>
<summary>Example statement</summary>

```
IF (popcorn_type is microwave)
  use microwave
ELSE IF (popcorn_type is stovetop)
  use stove
ELSE 
  use air fryer

```
Your version may look different, and that's fine! The fun of pseudocode is practicing with the logic of code, rather than getting lots in the details.

## Boolean Operators

In programming, most things boil down to `true` or `false`. (Sometimes you may see true/false capitalized as `TRUE` and `FALSE`, but the concept is the same. We'll use both ways throughout.)\

Programming uses Boolean operators such as:\

- `and` (may also see `&` used)
- `or` (may also see `|` used)
- `not` (may also see `!` to indicate negation, for instance `!=` for "not equal")
- `equals` (also `==`) 
  - [SL note: most Boolean operator lists include AND, OR, NOT - should we include EQUALS here or keep as separate part of testing true/false?]


## Exercise - `ifelse` trace 

Let's look at some examples of conditional statements in practice, first by using our cheesy mashed potatoes example, and then with actual code.

First, for our recipe example:

```
if cheese == hard:
  print("Grate the cheese.")
else if cheese == hard:
  print("Cube the cheese.")
else:
  print("Do not use this in this recipe.")
  
```

If we have `cheese <- parmesan` we would expect this statement to print out `Grate the cheese`. If we have `cheese <- brie` we would expect the output to be `Cube the cheese`. And if we have `cheese <- broccoli` we would expect the output to be `Do not use this in the recipe`. 

_Sidenote: yes, this assumes that somewhere we have specified a list of hard cheese and soft cheeses. For this pseudocode example, we're using our cheese-based expertise to draw conclusions, but as we've covered, we would never assume a computer would know which cheeses were hard or soft!_


__Exercise__

_For this exercise, want you to type the answer in the chat, but don't press enter until we tell you.  We'll say, _3, 2, 1, enter_ then you press enter when we say _enter_._

For the code below, what will be the printed output? 

```
x <- 37
y <- 42

if x == y:
  print("values are equal")
else if x > y:
  print("x greater than y")
else:
  print("x must be less than y")
  
```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

x must be less than y 

</details>\

What would be the answer if we instead set `x` and `y` to:

```
x <- 75
y <- 9

if x == y:
  print("values are equal")
else if x > y:
  print("x greater than y")
else:
  print("x must be less than y")

```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

x greater than y

</details>\

## Caveats

### Order of operations

Order of operations is critical for conditionals. The computer will go through each condition _in order_, so if an early condition is satisfied, the statement will conclude there and not check the other conditions.

__[[insert example here]]__

### Matching parentheses

For complex nested conditionals, be sure to use parentheses, and be sure parentheses are matched properly.

The code below, without a closing parentheses after "equal", will continue to expect input.

```
if (x == y) 
  print("values are equal"
  
```

As far as the programming language is concerned, you haven't finished this `if` statement. So, it will wait to run until you have "completed your thought", so to speak, and provided the syntax (here, `)`) indicating that this statement is complete and the program is ready to run.

Alternately, if you have mismatched parentheses, the result may be an error.

```
if (x == y) 
  print("values are equal"))
  
```
In this case, there is an extra closing parentheses `)` after `print("values are equal")` that doesn't have a matching `(` anywhere in the statement. The resulting error would look like:

```
Error: unexpected ')' in:
"if (x == y) {
    print("values are equal"))"
    
```

### Formatting may vary

Programming languages may have specific formatting for conditional statements. This may mean certain brackets must be used, new lines are required between sections, or tab indents are needed.

For example, Python expects `:` at the end of each section of an `ifelse` statement, uses `elif` for `else if`, and requires indentation to indicate action of each section:

```
if x == y:
  print("values are equal")
elif x > y:
  print("x greater than y")
else:
  print("x must be less than y")

```

In contract, R makes use of curly brackets `{}` to indicate each section of an `ifelse` statement and while indentation is a convention for readability, it is not technically required for the code to run:

```
if (x == y) {
  print("values are equal")
} else if (x > y) {
  print("x greater than y")
} else {
  print("x must be less than y")
}

```
