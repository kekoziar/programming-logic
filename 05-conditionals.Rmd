# Conditionals and Making Choices

Many times in programming, we want to take a certain action only if a certain condition is satisfied.\

To do this, we can use conditional statements. The most commonly used format of a conditional statement in programming is an `if` statement, which is often combined with an `else` statement.\

This structure tells the computer to check a condition and the next step depends on whether the condition is true or false. 

It takes the basic form of

```
IF (condition A is TRUE)
  do something
ELSE 
  do something different
```

In terms of our cheesy mashed potatoes algorithm, an `if` statement might look like this

```
ingredient <- cheddar cheese

IF (ingredient is (a type of hard cheese))
  grate(ingredient)
```


In programming format, this narrative statement would look like: 

```
IF (condition A is TRUE)
  do something
ELSE 
  do something different
```

Note that `else` here is used equivalent to "if not true", meaning `A == FALSE`.\

We are not limited to a single `TRUE`/`FALSE` check in an `if else` statement, where actions are limited to "x if true, y in all other scenarios".

The `else if` (written as `elif` in some programming languages) concept allows us to add another sequential check if the `if` statement is not true. Our updated narrative statement might be: "If condition A is true, do action X. If condition B is true, do action Z. If neither condition A or condition B are true, do action Y."\

In programming format, this updated narrative statement would look like: 

```
IF conditionA == TRUE, do X
ELSE IF conditionB == TRUE, do Z
ELSE do Y

```

## Boolean Operators

In programming, most things boil down to `true` or `false`. (Sometimes you may see true/false capitalized as `TRUE` and `FALSE`, but the concept is the same.)\

Programming uses Boolean operators such as:\

- `and` (may also see `&` used)
- `or` (may also see `|` used)
- `not` (may also see `!` to indicate negation, for instance `!=` for "not equal")
- `equals` (also `==`) 
  - [SL note: most Boolean operator lists include AND, OR, NOT - should we include EQUALS here or keep as separate part of testing true/false?]


## Exercise - `ifelse` trace 

Let's look at some examples of conditional statements in practice.

```
if x == y:
  print("values are equal")
else if x > y:
  print("x greater than y")
else:
  print("x must be less than y")
  
```
For the first trace, we will set the values of `x` and `y` as:

```
x <- 37
y <- 42

```

What will be the printed output from this `ifelse` section?\

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
x must be less than y 
</details>\

What if we reset `x` and `y` to:

```
x <- 75
y <- 9

```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
x greater than y
</details>\

## Caveats

### Order of operations

Order of operations is critical for conditionals. The computer will go through each condition __in order__, so if an early condition is satisfied, the statement will conclude there and not check the other conditions.

__[[insert example here]]__

### Matching parentheses

For complex nested conditionals, be sure to use parentheses, and be sure parentheses are matched properly.

The code below, without a closing parentheses after "equal", will continue to expect input.

```
if (x == y) 
  print("values are equal"
  
```

As far as the programming language is concerned, you haven't finished this `if` statement. So, it will wait to run until you have "completed your thought", so to speak, and provided the syntax (here, `)`) indicating that this statement is complete and the program is ready to run.

Alternately, if you have mismatched parentheses, the result may be an error.

```
if (x == y) 
  print("values are equal"))
  
```
In this case, there is an extra closing parentheses `)` after `print("values are equal")` that doesn't have a matching `(` anywhere in the statement. The resulting error would look like:

```
Error: unexpected ')' in:
"if (x == y) {
    print("values are equal"))"
    
```

### Formatting may vary

Programming languages may have specific formatting for conditional statements. This may mean certain brackets must be used, new lines are required between sections, or tab indents are needed.

For example, Python expects `:` at the end of each section of an `ifelse` statement, uses `elif` for `else if`, and requires indentation to indicate action of each section:

```
if x == y:
  print("values are equal")
elif x > y:
  print("x greater than y")
else:
  print("x must be less than y")

```

In contract, R makes use of curly brackets `{}` to indicate each section of an `ifelse` statement and while indentation is a convention for readability, it is not technically required for the code to run:

```
if (x == y) {
  print("values are equal")
} else if (x > y) {
  print("x greater than y")
} else {
  print("x must be less than y")
}

```
