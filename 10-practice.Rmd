# Practice annotating and understanding unfamiliar code

## Nested `for` loops and `if else` statements (in Python)

Here is an example of code that is scraping content from a set of website pages and saving that content locally. It uses 'nested' `for` loops, meaning a second loop occurs within the first loops. It also uses nested `if else` statements. 

__SL: we can simplify this example, maybe remove session_id and save_loc__

For this code, can you identify where each `for` loop and each `if else` statement ends? Or put another way, can you figure out on which lines (numbered in code chunk below) each statement starts and stops?

```
1.  base_url = "https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/"
2.  data_url = "DataFiles.aspx?"
3.  year_base = "year="
4.  years = ["1995", "1996", "1997", "1998"]
5.  session_id = "&sid=4f8f293f-df75-42cd-9cc0-ed184270cf17&rtid=7"  #you might need to change this
6. 
7.  # what type of files do you want to save?
8.  file_type = ["zip","csv"]
9. 
10. # where do you want to save locally?
11. 
12. # save_loc is redundant, but a reminder that you should have locally folders that reflect the years, 13. because that's where below is saving to
14. save_loc = years 
15. 
16. # what kind of prefix do you want on your files
17. save_prefix = "ipeds_" 
18. 
19. # scrape
20. for year in years:
21.     url = base_url+data_url+year_base+year+session_id 
22.     webpage = requests.get(url)
23.     soup = BeautifulSoup(webpage.content, 'html.parser')
24. 
25. 
26.     if os.path.isdir("./"+year):
27.         # notice output path has "year" as a variable indicating folders
28.         output_path = "./"+year+"/"+save_prefix+year+"_"+".html"
29.     
30.         if os.path.exists(output_path):
31.             print(output_path+" already exists. Did NOT save.")
32.         else:
33.             # saving the html file
34.             print("saving "+output_path)
35.     
36.             with open(output_path, 'wb') as file:
37.                 file.write(webpage.content) 
38.             
39.         # saving files linked on original html page which meet file type requirement
40.         for link in soup.find_all('a')[0:16]:  
41.             data_target = link.get('href')
42.             # data_target[-3:]
43.             if any(extension == data_target[-3:] for extension in file_type):
44.                 wget_url = base_url+data_target
45.                 wget_save = "./"+year+"/"+save_prefix+data_target.replace("/","-")
46.     
47.                 if os.path.exists(wget_save):
48.                     print(wget_save+" already exists. Did NOT save.")
49.                 else:
50.                     print("SAVING "+ wget_url+ " at local location: "+wget_save)
51.                     wget.download(wget_url,wget_save)
52.                     time.sleep(.25) # be kind, don't look like a DDOS attack
53.     else:
54.         print("\n!!! save directory "+year+" does NOT exist. please create\n")
55.     
56.     
57. print("fin.")

```

## New types of conditions (in SQL)

Consider the following SQL command:

```
SELECT * FROM OceanBuoys
WHERE Ocean = 'Atlantic' AND (BuoyName LIKE 'S%' OR BuoyName LIKE 'K%');

```

Your preferred approach for navigating and understanding unfamiliar code may vary.\

One option is to break down code into its component parts. Here you can separate out functions (common tasks across programming languages) from data-specific variables and names. Can you identify:

- What does the `OceanBuoys` term most likely refer to?
- What do you think the `SELECT` function does?
- What does `*` indicate, in combination with `SELECT`? 
- Parsing the second line that starts with `WHERE`, can you make an educated guess about what `Country` and `BuoyName` refer to?
- Can you guess (or feel free to use Google) what `LIKE 'S%'` and `LIKE 'K%'` would indicate?

<details>
<summary>Do your answers match these?</summary>
- The `OceanBuoys` term here refers to a table or dataframe. 
- The `SELECT` function selects columns from a table. 
- The `*` here indicates that we want to return all columns from the table. 
- The `OceanBuoys` table must have columns named `Country` and `BuoyName`. 
- `LIKE` is used for pattern matching. This code is matching values that start with "S" or with "K".
</details>\

Now, can you write out a narrative of what you see the code is trying to do?\

<details>
<summary>Example written narrative</summary>
Starting from the `OceanBuoys` table, return all columns but only rows where `Country` is equal to "Spain" __and__ where the `BuoyName` value starts with "S" or "K".

## Challenge practice: new syntax and terms (in R)

While the logic underlying programming languages stays consistent, a central challenge is that different languages often have their own special syntax, which can take a while to get used to. But don't panic! Familiarity comes with experience and in the meantime, Google is your friend.\

In the code example below, note the new symbol `%>%` and `%in%` and the new functions `mutate()` and `paste()`. The `select()` function at least is more familiar from the example above, and `ifelse` is an `if else` statement.

```
1.  df_new <- df %>% 
2.    select(-respondent_name) %>% 
3.    mutate(identifier = paste(respondent_id, survey_wave, sep = "_")) %>% 
4.    mutate(survey_type = ifelse(survey_wave %in% c("first", "second"), "phone", "in person"))
  
```
Task: go line by line and annotate, in your own words, what that line of code is doing.\

Each line has a new take on the same logic we've covered in prior sections; a breakdown of new terms is below, to guide your annotation.

- Line 1
  - What is `df_new <- df` doing here?
  - What does the `%>%` symbol indicate?
- Line 2
  - What is the `select()` function likely doing? 
  - What might it mean that the argument in this function is preceded by `-`?
- Line 3
  - Using context clues (and Google) what do you think the `mutate()` function does?
  - The new `paste()` function has three arguments (`paste(arg1, arg2, arg3)`). What do you think the arguments are for?
- Line 4
  - This `ifelse()` statement has a different format than we've covered so far, but the concept is the same. Assuming this `ifelse()` statement has three arguments (`ifelse(condition, mystery1, mystery2)`) what might the two mystery arguments be specifying?
  - Looking at the section `survey_wave %in% c("first", "second")`, what do you think this would translate to, as a written explanation of the task here?

Finally, it is always important to understand the data type and structure of the data being acted upon. Based on the questions above, what is the structure of the data being used here?
