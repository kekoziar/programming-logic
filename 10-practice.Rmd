# Practice 

In this section, we'll work on understanding and annotating unfamiliar code.

## New types of conditions (in SQL)

Consider the following SQL command:

```
SELECT * FROM OceanBuoys
WHERE Ocean = 'Atlantic' AND (BuoyName LIKE 'S%' OR BuoyName LIKE 'K%');

```

Your preferred approach for navigating and understanding unfamiliar code may vary.\

One option is to break down code into its component parts. Here you can separate out functions (common tasks across programming languages) from data-specific variables and names. Can you identify:

- What does the `OceanBuoys` term most likely refer to?
- What do you think the `SELECT` function does?
- What does `*` indicate, in combination with `SELECT`? 
- Parsing the second line that starts with `WHERE`, can you make an educated guess about what `Country` and `BuoyName` refer to?
- Can you guess (or feel free to use Google) what `LIKE 'S%'` and `LIKE 'K%'` would indicate?

<details>
<summary>Do your answers match these?</summary>

- The `OceanBuoys` term here refers to a table or dataframe. 
- The `SELECT` function selects columns from a table. 
- The `*` here indicates that we want to return all columns from the table. 
- The `OceanBuoys` table must have columns named `Country` and `BuoyName`. 
- `LIKE` is used for pattern matching. This code is matching values that start with "S" or with "K".
</details>\

Now, can you write out a narrative of what you see the code is trying to do?\

<details>
<summary>Example written narrative</summary>

Starting from the `OceanBuoys` table, return all columns but only rows where `Country` is equal to "Spain" _and_ where the `BuoyName` value starts with "S" or "K".

## Nested `for` loops and `if else` statements (in Python)

Here is an example of code that is scraping content from a set of website pages and saving that content locally. It uses 'nested' `for` loops, meaning a second loop occurs within the first loops. It also uses nested `if else` statements with the `for` loops and within other `if else` statements.\

In this example, we're less concerned about understanding every detail about what the code is doing, and more about understanding where each loop beings and ends. This is a useful skill - looking at code and understanding where the boundaries are for each self-contained function. It is especially helpful when troubleshooting. For instance, if there is an error or unexpected result, a first item to check is often: are functions, especially loops and conditional statements, started and ended properly in matched fashion?\

__Exercise__: Review the code chunk below and identify on which line each `for` loop and each `if else` statement starts and ends? 

- First `for` loop
  - Starts on line:
  - Ends on line:
  
- Second `for` loop
  - Starts on line:
  - Ends on line:
  
- (sneaky third for in line 43?)
  
- First `if else` statement
  - Starts on line:
  - Ends on line:
  
- Second `if else` statement
  - Starts on line:
  - Ends on line:
  
- Third `if else` statement
  - Starts on line:
  - Ends on line:
  
- Fourth `if else` statement
  - Starts on line:
  - Ends on line:

## New syntax and terms (in R)

While the logic underlying programming languages stays consistent, a central challenge is that different languages often have their own special syntax, which can take a while to get used to. But don't panic! Familiarity comes with experience and in the meantime, Google is your friend.\

In the code example below, note the new symbol `%>%` and `%in%` and the new functions `mutate()` and `paste()`. The `select()` function at least is more familiar from the example above, and `ifelse` is an `if else` statement.

```
1.  df_new <- df %>% 
2.    select(-respondent_name) %>% 
3.    mutate(identifier = paste(respondent_id, survey_wave, sep = "_")) %>% 
4.    mutate(survey_type = ifelse(survey_wave %in% c("first", "second"), "phone", "in person"))
  
```
Task: go line by line and annotate, in your own words, what that line of code is doing.\

Each line has a new take on the same logic we've covered in prior sections; a breakdown of new terms is below, to guide your annotation.

- Line 1
  - What is `df_new <- df` doing here?
  - What does the `%>%` symbol indicate?
- Line 2
  - What is the `select()` function likely doing? 
  - What might it mean that the argument in this function is preceded by `-`?
- Line 3
  - Using context clues (and Google) what do you think the `mutate()` function does?
  - The new `paste()` function has three arguments (`paste(arg1, arg2, arg3)`). What do you think the arguments are for?
- Line 4
  - This `ifelse()` statement has a different format than we've covered so far, but the concept is the same. Assuming this `ifelse()` statement has three arguments (`ifelse(condition, mystery1, mystery2)`) what might the two mystery arguments be specifying?
  - Looking at the section `survey_wave %in% c("first", "second")`, what do you think this would translate to, as a written explanation of the task here?
  
Finally, it is always important to understand the data type and structure of the data being acted upon. Keep in mind, based on the questions above, what is the structure of the data being used here?
  
<details>
<summary>Example narrative</summary>

Starting from the table/dataframe called "df", we want to keep (select) all columns _except_ the column named "respondent_name".\

Then, make a new column called "identifier". This new column is created by pasting together the value in the "respondent_id" column and the "survey_wave" column, separated by an underscore.\

Then, make another new column called "survey_type". The values in this column are determined by an `ifelse` statement: if the value in the "survey_wave" column is any of the values specified in the list `("first", "second")` (so if the value is "first" or "second"), then the value in the "survey_type" column will be "phone". Otherwise, the value will be "in person".\
