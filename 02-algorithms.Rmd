# Algorithms

overview of algorithms and computer code/scripting

## Breakout Activity

For this activity, you will write an algorithm to make popcorn.\ 

Sounds simple, right? "Make popcorn" is something most people have at least a general understanding of how to do. But in this scenario, you're providing step-by-step directions for a computer to understand how to make popcorn and a computer would need to be told __every action__ to take, in order to successfully make popcorn.\

Your task is to write out each step needed to make popcorn. 

As you write out the steps with your group, consider:

- Are you opening a container at any point?
- Are you making microwave popcorn, or using a stove?
- How much time is needed to make popcorn?
- What should the computer do if the popcorn starts burning?
