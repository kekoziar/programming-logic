# Algorithms

Most people have heard the term algorithm, especially in relation to AI or social media feeds, but what is an algorithm?  An algorithm is a set of instructions for how to do something. For AI, the term algorithm is often used as a term to represent the overall way that whatever AI that you’re working with was trained to do what it does.  For social media feeds, an algorithm will determine how to select which content is delivered to a user.  Algorithms can be very simple or very complex.

A common analogy for an algorithm is a recipe. A recipe includes a set of ingredients, which are like the variables in your code, then lists instructions on what to do with the ingredients.  But, a big difference between common recipes that you are used to seeing and an algorithm is you have to be very exact and specific when you tell a computer to do something. It isn’t enough to tell a computer, “get the data.” You have to tell it where the data is located, what format it is in, how to read it, and what format you want the data in for use  in your script. So let’s do an example with a recipe on how to make 

- enchiladas?
- quesadillas?
- cheesy mashed potatoes?


## Breakout Activity

For this activity, you will write an algorithm to make popcorn.\ 

Sounds simple, right? "Make popcorn" is something most people have at least a general understanding of how to do. But in this scenario, you're providing step-by-step directions for a computer to understand how to make popcorn and a computer would need to be told __every action__ to take, in order to successfully make popcorn.\

Your task is to write out each step needed to make popcorn. 

As you write out the steps with your group, consider:

- Are you opening a container at any point?
- Are you making microwave popcorn, or using a stove?
- How much time is needed to make popcorn?
- What should the computer do if the popcorn starts burning?
