# Algorithms

Most people have heard the term algorithm, especially in relation to AI or social media feeds, but what is an algorithm?  An algorithm is a set of instructions for how to do something. For AI, the term algorithm is often used as a term to represent the overall way that whatever AI that you’re working with was trained to do what it does.  For social media feeds, an algorithm will determine how to select which content is delivered to a user.  Algorithms can be very simple or very complex.

A common analogy for an algorithm is a recipe. A recipe includes a set of ingredients, which are like the variables in your code, then lists instructions on what to do with the ingredients.  But, a big difference between common recipes that you are used to seeing and an algorithm is you have to be very exact and specific when you tell a computer to do something. It isn’t enough to tell a computer, “get the data.” You have to tell it where the data is located, what format it is in, how to read it, and what format you want the data in for use  in your script. So let’s do an example with a recipe on how to make cheesy mashed potatoes.

The steps are easy enough. 

1. Take potatoes and boil them until they're done. 
2. Drain. 
3. Add butter, milk, salt/pepper to taste. 
4. Mash. 
5. Fold in cheese. 
6. Eat.

Most of us would know how to do this because we infer the instructions that are missing.  But, computers are stupid.  They need to be explicitly told how to do something. 

How many potatoes?  What does _boil_ mean?  What does _done_ mean? (which is also a question I asked my mom when reading my grandmother's recipes.)

Ingredients
3 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter
1/2 cup milk 
Salt and freshly ground pepper 
1 cup shredded cheddar 

*Algorithm for making Cheesy Mashed Potatoes*

1. Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover with water by an inch. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to simmer. Cook until the potatoes are fork tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Drain.
2. Return the potatoes to the pot and add the butter, milk and some salt and pepper. Mash the potatoes to the desired consistency. While still hot, fold the cheese into the mash and stir to melt.


## Breakout Activity

For this activity, you will write an algorithm to make popcorn.\ 

Sounds simple, right? "Make popcorn" is something most people have at least a general understanding of how to do. But in this scenario, you're providing step-by-step directions for a computer to understand how to make popcorn and a computer would need to be told __every action__ to take, in order to successfully make popcorn.\

Your task is to write out each step needed to make popcorn. 

As you write out the steps with your group, consider:

- Are you opening a container at any point?
- Are you making microwave popcorn, or using a stove?
- How much time is needed to make popcorn?
- What should the computer do if the popcorn starts burning?
