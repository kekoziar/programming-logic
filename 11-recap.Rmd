# Recap and Consultation Tips

The point of this workshop isn't to make you an expert, but to build your skillset so you can read code and be more confident in consultations.  

## Approaching Consultations

Consultations may seem scary, especially if you aren't familiar with a particular language, but the nice thing about programming languages is the concepts are so similar across languages, many of the issues students and researchers come with aren't specific to the language, per se.  That is, sometimes it's something as simple as a variable not being assigned properly.  That isn't language specific, but requires someone to be able to trace the code.

Here are some tips on approaching consultations

- Include a prompt for anyone scheduling a consultation to provide as much detail as possible.  _Please share anything that will help prepare for our meeting. Include your specific research question or problem._ This will help you to prepare in advance.  I've followed up via email, asking researchers if they'd share their code/data in advance.

have student talk through their code
Be clear with what you can and cannot do.
Helping with programming vs statistics (for when they ask for help with interpreting something Full disclosure, I am not a statistician) 
Troubleshooting vs consult
Ok to say you don’t know! Point to documentation and learning resources


## Narrowing Down Errors

You might think there's a lot of places where errors can be introduced in code, 
especially if it's a hundred lines, but you can usually narrow down the errors
to a few places.

### Does the Code Run or Not?

Syntax errors - a missing quote or paren that's supposed to close a delimiter pair,  a
missing semicolon, the computer trying to open a file that doesn't exist in
the location indicated by the path - these will all result in error messages.  The
code generally won't even run.  

That's the nice thing about syntax errors, is the code doesn't run and will give
you an indication of where to look to correct the error.

Here's an example in R.  The code is


```c 
if (x == y {
  print("values are equal");
} else if (x > y) {
  print("x greater than y");
} else {
  print("x must be less than y");
}
```

But, when we run it, the console indicates
<code><br>
> if (x == y {<br>
<span style="color: red;">Error: unexpected '{' in "if (x == y {"</span>
</code>




Three Areas For Errors
Code not running at all → often a syntax error

Running unexpectedly / unexpected output
