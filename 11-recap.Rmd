# Recap and Consultation Tips

The point of this workshop isn't to make you an expert, but to build your skillset so you can read code and be more confident in consultations.  Let's first talk about where errors can pop up.

## Narrowing Down Errors

You might think there's a lot of places where errors can be introduced in code, 
especially if it's a hundred lines, but you can usually narrow down the errors
to a few places.

### Why Doesn't My Code Run?

Syntax errors - a missing quote or paren that's supposed to close a delimiter pair,  a
missing semicolon, the computer trying to open a file that doesn't exist in
the location indicated by the path - these will all result in error messages.  The
code generally won't even run.  

That's the nice thing about syntax errors, is the code doesn't run and will give
you an indication of where to look to correct the error.

Here's an example in R.  The code is


```c 
if (x == y {
  print("values are equal");
} else if (x > y) {
  print("x greater than y");
} else {
  print("x must be less than y");
}
```

But, when we run it, the console indicates
<pre><code>> if (x == y {
<span style="color: red;">Error: unexpected '{' in "if (x == y {"</span></code></pre>

<hr>
Similarly, if we try to run something in Jupyter Notebook using Python with an error...

```python
if (x == y:
  print("values are equal")
elif (x > y):
  print("x greater than y")
else:
  print("x must be less than y")
```
...we will get an error message...

<pre style="background-color: #ffdede; display:block; border: none; padding: 0px;"><code style="background-color: #ffdede; display:block; padding: 10px"><span style="color: #278da2;">   Cell</span> <span style="color: #00736a;">In[7], line 1</span>
     <span style="color: #b17f25;">if (x == y:</span>
               <span style="color: #a1a6b1;">^</span>
<span style="color: #b23635;">SyntaxError:</span> <span style="color: black;">invalid syntax</span></code></pre>


...with the specific location where the error started

As stated in earlier chapters, it's important to read through the error message, 
usually from bottom then working your way up.  Sometimes error messages can be
quite long.  If you want to practice this for a particular
language, there are recommended lessons in the Resources chapter.


### The Code Runs, but Something is Wrong


It's a little trickier to troubleshoot when the code runs, but does something 
unexpected. Unexpected output might look like incorrect results, it could be a
graph or chart doesn't look right.  This is trickier because it might be the 
*logic* of the code.  

Things I scan for before looking at the logic are making sure the correct data files
are being requested, and making sure the location of the images the researcher is 
showing me matches with the file path indicated in the code. 

If those match, then it's useful to ask the researcher to walk through the code 
and explain it to you.  Which brings us to tips for how to approach consultations. 

## Approaching Consultations

Consultations may seem scary, especially if you aren't familiar with a particular language, but the nice thing about programming languages is the concepts are so similar across languages, many of the issues students and researchers come with aren't specific to the language, per se.  That is, sometimes it's something as simple as a variable not being assigned properly.  That isn't language specific, but requires someone to be able to trace the code.

Here are some tips on approaching consultations

- **Prepare in Advance.** Include a prompt for anyone scheduling a consultation to provide as much detail as possible.  _Please share anything that will help prepare for our meeting. Include your specific research question or problem._ This will help you to prepare in advance.  I've followed up via email, asking researchers if they'd share their code/data in advance.
- **Be clear with what you can and cannot do.** You don't need to be an expert 
in order to provide consultations for programming support, but you should be
clear in what you can do.  For example, I have provided many Stata 
consultations.  I have never used Stata, and I am clear with that to establish 
reasonable expectations.  *Just so you know, I'm familiar with Stata, but not an 
expert. If you want, we can meet and talk through your research and code.*
- **Have the researcher talk through their code.** This does a few things: it 
helps you understand what they're trying to do with their code and research 
project. More importantly, they will get a clearer understanding of what's going 
on because they are describing it.  Sometimes the act of them reading through
and describing the code will allow the researcher to see some of the issues,
and fix it on their own.
- **Programming vs statistics.** Sometimes the researcher will ask for an 
explanation or interpretation of a PCA, linear regression, or other analysis. 
*Full disclosure, I've taken some machine learning and stats classes, but I am 
not a statistician.* Talking through the problem often helps. 
  - If they share that they're using someone else's code with their own data, 
  the first thing to ask is if the code works with the original data.  The next 
  thing to ask is to walk through the similarities and differences 
  with the new data, and how the variables of the different datasets relate.
  - Know where they can get statistics consultations at your institution.
- **Troubleshooting vs Consult.** Understanding the difference between these two
will help you manage time and expectations.
  - Troubleshooting is often shorter, even though
it can take time depending on the problem.  Troubleshooting benefits from having
access to the code and data beforehand, especially for things that you aren't
familiar with.  For example, I knew R, but for several years wasn't familiar 
with the Tidyverse collection of packages. Having the code/data prior allowed me
to save the time of the researcher [@wikipediaFiveLaws], focus the time of our 
consultations, while
giving me an opportunity to learn how to use Tidyverse.
  - Consultations are often more in-depth than troubleshooting, and will include
  more *how* to do something, best practices for file/variable names, managing
  data, sometimes even how to program. 
- **It's ok to say you donâ€™t know!** As long as you clearly communicate what
you can and can't do, and share that you're willing to help the researcher find
assistance you can't provide, most researchers will be thankful and 
understanding if you *don't know.* One of the best professors I ever had would 
sometimes answer questions with *I don't know, but I'll look that up and get back
you you.*  It's a philosophy I've incorporated into my professional services, 
*I don't know, but I'll help you find the answers.* Have a list of go-to documentation and learning resources to point to when needed.
