# Practice 

In this section, we'll work on annotating and understanding unfamiliar code.

The code examples may look intimidating! But remember, we're less concerned here about understanding every detail about what the code is doing, and more about using what we've learned about programming logic as a lens through which to begin interpreting code.

## New types of conditions (in SQL)

Consider the following SQL command:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM OceanBuoys
WHERE Ocean = 'Atlantic' AND (BuoyName LIKE 'S%' OR BuoyName LIKE 'K%');

```

One option for navigating unfamiliar code is to break down the code into its 
component parts. Using that approach, you can differentiate functions separate from variables and names to get a better understanding of what type of data you're working with, and what the code is trying to do. 

__Exercise__: Using what we've learned in prior sections, try to answer the following questions.

- What does the `OceanBuoys` term most likely refer to - variable or function?
  - Tip: Variables will contain a data object. Functions perform an action or task.
- Assuming that `SELECT` is a function, what might it do?
- The `*` character is new. What might `*` indicate, in combination with `SELECT`? 
- Parsing the second line that starts with `WHERE`, can you make an educated guess about what `Ocean` and `BuoyName` refer to, in terms of variables?
- Can you guess (or feel free to use your favorite search engine) what `LIKE 'S%'` and `LIKE 'K%'` would indicate?
- Note the `;` at the end of the line starting with `WHERE`. What might this mean?

<details>
<summary>Do your answers match these?</summary>

- The `OceanBuoys` term here refers to a table or dataframe or matrix (really, any kind of tabular format). 
- The `SELECT` function selects columns from the `OceanBuoys` table. 
- The `*` is a wildcard matching symbol. It indicates that we want to return _all_ columns from the table, no matter what their column names are. 
- The `OceanBuoys` table must have columns named `Ocean` and `BuoyName`. 
  - If we wanted to return only these columns, the syntax could be: `SELECT Ocean, BuoyName FROM OceanBuoys`
- `LIKE` is used for pattern matching. The symbol `%` is a wildcard character in SQL. This code is matching values that start with "S" or with "K".
- The conditions after `WHERE` are the row-based conditions for what will be returned, analogous to `SELECT` for the column-specific condition.
- The `;` is used to indicate the end of a statement in SQL. It tells the computer that the 'thought' is finished, and the action of _doing_ the thought can commence.
</details>\

**Exercise, continued:** Now, can you write out a narrative of what you see the code is trying to do?

<details>
<summary>Example written narrative</summary>

This code is returning a subset of data from the `OceanBuoys` table. Starting from the full `OceanBuoys` table, return all the columns from this table, but keep only rows where `Ocean` is equal to "Atlantic" _and_ where the `BuoyName` value starts with "S" or "K". The returned data should be tabular, with the same number of columns as the full `OceanBuoys` table, but likely with less rows (only those that met the condition).

## New syntax and terms (in R)

While the logic underlying programming languages stays consistent, a central challenge is that different languages often have their own special syntax, which can take a while to get used to. Don't panic! Familiarity comes with experience and in the meantime, Google is your friend (well, the search engine of your choice.  Some of us prefer DuckDuckGo).\

Here is an example of R code:

```r
1.  df_new <- df %>% 
2.    select(-respondent_name) %>% 
3.    mutate(identifier = paste(respondent_id, survey_wave, sep = "_")) %>% 
4.    mutate(survey_type = 
5.           ifelse(survey_wave %in% c("first", "second"), "phone", "in person"))
  
```
__Exercise__: Go line by line and annotate, in your own words, what that line of code is doing. Then, combine these into a written narrative of what this code is doing.\

Each line has a new take on the same logic we've covered in prior sections; a breakdown of new terms is below to guide your annotation.

- Line 1
  - What is `df_new <- df` doing here?
    - Hint: refer to 8.1.3, Common Variable Names
  - What does the `%>%` symbol indicate?
- Line 2
  - What is the `select()` function likely doing? 
  - What might it mean that the argument in this function is preceded by `-`?
- Line 3
  - Using context clues (and your favorite search engine) what do you think the `mutate()` function does?
  - The new `paste()` function has three arguments (`paste(arg1, arg2, arg3)`). What do you think the arguments are for?
- Line 4 & 5 (note: new line not strictly necessary, only to fit in page width without needing scroll)
  - This `ifelse()` statement has a different format than we've covered so far, but the concept is the same. Assuming this `ifelse()` statement has three arguments (`ifelse(condition, mystery1, mystery2)`) what might the two mystery arguments be specifying?
  - Looking at the section `survey_wave %in% c("first", "second")`, what do you think this would translate to, as a written explanation of the task here?
- Finally, it is always important to understand the data type and structure of the data being acted upon. Keep in mind, based on the questions above, what is the structure of the data being used here?
  
<details>
<summary>Example narrative</summary>

Starting from the table/dataframe called `df`, we want to keep (`select`) all columns _except_ the column named `respondent_name`.\

Then, make a new column called `identifier`. This new column is created by pasting together the value in the `respondent_id` column and the `survey_wave` column, separated by an underscore, `_`.\

Then, make another new column called `survey_type`. The values in this column are determined by an `ifelse` statement: if the value in the `survey_wave` column is any of the values specified in the list `("first", "second")` (so if the value is `first` or `second`), then the value in the `survey_type` column will be `phone`. Otherwise, the value will be `in person`.\

## New functions in Stata

This challenge uses Stata, a proprietary statistical analysis platform. Stata has a number of unique features and syntax that can make it challenging to interpret. (At least in this instructor's experience, Stata is not user-friendly, but your mileage may vary!)

Relying on what we've learned so far and context clues, what is the code below doing?

```stata
replace variable = variable[_n-1] if missing(variable)
```
<details>
<summary>What is this code doing?</summary>
This is a bit of code to replace any missing values of `variable` with with previous (`n-1`) value of `variable`. 

There are [many ways to replace missing values in Stata](https://www.stata.com/support/faqs/data-management/replacing-missing-values/), this is one.
