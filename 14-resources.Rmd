# Resources

Here's a list of resources, cheat sheets, reference materials, and stuff we really like and recommend.

- For practical, research-focused language-specific training (R, Python, SQL, Bash, etc.), we recommend [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/lessons/) lessons.
  - You can also use these for reminders of how certain functions are called.
  - Pro Tip: be sure to leave enough time for the lessons.  R & Python will each take
  about 8 hours, Bash & Git will take about 4 hours each.  But, you will be about
  at an intermediate level when you finish these lessons.

_Help troubleshooting code_

- Check language/platform-specific message boards to see if someone else has encountered a similar problem.
  - [Python](https://discuss.python.org/c/help/7)
  - [R](https://forum.posit.co/)
  - [SAS](https://communities.sas.com/)
  - [SPSS](https://www.ibm.com/products/spss-statistics/support)
  - [Stata](https://www.statalist.org/)
  
- Search [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions) 
  - Programming community forum. Specify what language/platform in your search term (ex: "R plotting change axes")
  - Pro tip: use your favorite search engine, and prioritize StackOverflow.

- Use your favorite search engine and search the error code + name of software or
the name of the software and the function or operator. 
  - Example: “R error default.density need at least 2 points to select a bandwidth automatically”
    - This will often surface relevant StackOverflow posts\\
  - "R %>%" will tell you about this operator common to the tidyverse.

- Check documentation for specific function/package/program 
  - User guides/docs for “official” add-on packages to software
  - Example: error/problem implementing “bmacoefsample” in Stata? → Find documentation for bmacoefsample - Posterior samples of regression coefficients - read syntax description 
  
**Did you like this style of learning?**

Do you want to learn the ins and outs of computer programming, including memory 
allocation, logic gates, and more?  

- Introduction to Programming Logic [@lynne_ohanlon_introduction_2000]
  - This is a very accessible and readable programming logic book.  This was written
  by one of Kat's computer science instructors, to whom Kat is eternally grateful 
  for a logical and structured approach to learning how to program.
