# Loops

Drawing from Introduction to Programming Logic[@lynne_ohanlon_introduction_2000]
Start with `for` loop as first function term
“Populate an array from a for loop” as an early example; pg 376 blank table with good early exercise.
Side note about infinite loop, importance of settling bounds
What happens if you don’t tell loop to increase?
Examples of `for` loops in multiple languages (Python, C, R)?
To decide: all theory and then all practice, or theory/practice/theory/practice?
Also writing out result of each iteration otherwise you’ll only get the last result (a common problem)

## Exercise - populate an array

Let's use a `for` loop to populate an array.

We'll start with an empty array called `table` with 4 rows and columns named A, B, C, D, and E:

| A | B | C | D | E |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |

Our `for` loop:

Grab and pen and paper (or a spreadsheet program like Google Sheets or Excel) and manually fill in the empty cells in the array.

- What is the number in cell A1?
- What is the number in cell B2?
- What is the number in cell D4?

<summary>Your filled array should look like this</summary>

| A   | B   | C   | D   | E  |
|---  |---  |---  |---  |--- |
| 1   |  2  | 3   |  4  | 5  |
| 6   |  7  | 8   |  9  | 10 |
| 11  | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15 |
| 16  | 17  | 18  | 19  | 20 |

## Exercise - loop trace

Grab a pen and paper and write out the output of each iteration of the loop:

```
for (x in 0:5) 
  print(x)
```

## Other Types of Loops 
- while(check at beginning)
- do-while(check at end)
- until(check at end)
