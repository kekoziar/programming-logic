# Loops

Drawing from Introduction to Programming Logic[@lynne_ohanlon_introduction_2000]
Start with `for` loop as first function term
“Populate an array from a for loop” as an early example; pg 376 blank table with good early exercise.
Side note about infinite loop, importance of settling bounds
What happens if you don’t tell loop to increase?
Examples of `for` loops in multiple languages (Python, C, R)?
To decide: all theory and then all practice, or theory/practice/theory/practice?
Also writing out result of each iteration otherwise you’ll only get the last result (a common problem)

## Activity - loop trace


## Other Types of Loops 
- while(check at beginning)
- do-while(check at end)
- until(check at end)

## math example


You can also use math in footnotes like this^[where we mention $p = \frac{a}{b}$].

We will approximate standard error to 0.027
